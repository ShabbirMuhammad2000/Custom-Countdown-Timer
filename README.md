# Custom Countdown Timer
## Introduction
Welcome to the Custom Countdown Timer project! This interactive web application allows you to create and track countdowns to exciting future events. The countdown will display the time remaining in days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the specified start date. Once the countdown is complete, you'll be notified with a special "Countdown Completed!" message, and you'll have the option to create another countdown. Additionally, your countdowns will be automatically saved, ensuring that they persist even if you refresh the page or return later.
